# Path Tracking
Several path-tracking algorithms are (going to be) implemented with python.


## Vehicle Models for Simulation
### Dynamic Bicycle Model


### Unicycle Model
```sh
cd path_tracking
poetry run jupyter notebook notebooks/unicycle_model.ipynb
```

### Kinematic Bicycle Model



## Control Algorithms
### PID Control


### Pure-Pursuit Control


### Stanley Control


### State Feedback Control


### Linear Quadratic Regulator


### Model Predictive Control


### Model Predictive Path-Integral Control


### Sliding Mode Control
